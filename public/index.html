    <h1>The 250kb&nbsp;Club</h1>
    <p>
      The WWW has become a bloated mess. Many pages are loading megabytes of Javascript to show you a few kilobytes of content.
      These things are a <strong>cancerous growth</strong> on the web and we should stand up against it.
    </p>
    <p>We can make a difference - no matter how small it may seem. The <em>250kb Club</em> is a collection of web pages that focus on performance, efficiency and accessibility.</p>
    <p>
      If you'd like to suggest a web page to add to this collection, open a ticket on
      <a href="https://github.com/nkoehring/250kb-club" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Github</a>
      or
      <a href="https://sr.ht/~koehr/the-250kb-club/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Sourcehut</a>.
      The site will be reviewed and, if applicable, added to the list below.
    </p>
    <p>If your pages exceeds 250kb, you might consider <a href="https://1MB.club" rel="noopener" target="_blank">1MB.club</a> which is the inspiration for this page.</p>
