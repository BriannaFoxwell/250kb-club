  <h1>The 250kb&nbsp;Club</h1>
  <p>
    The WWW has become a bloated mess. Many pages are loading megabytes of Javascript to show you a few kilobytes of content.
    These things are a <strong>cancerous growth</strong> on the web and we should stand up against it.
  </p>
  <p>We can make a difference - no matter how small it may seem. The <em>250kb Club</em> is a collection of web pages that focus on performance, efficiency and accessibility.</p>
  <p>
    If you'd like to suggest a web page to add to this collection, open a ticket on
    <Link href="https://github.com/nkoehring/250kb-club">Github</Link>
    or
    <Link href="https://sr.ht/~koehr/the-250kb-club/">Sourcehut</Link>.
    The site will be reviewed and, if applicable, added to the list below.
  </p>
  <p>If your pages exceeds 250kb, you might consider <Link href="https://1MB.club">1MB.club</Link> which is the inspiration for this page.</p>
